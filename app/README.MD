### DATA MANAGEMENT IN COMPOSABLES 
- A composable defines the layout and elements in an app screen 
- The composables will contain data that will allow our user to interact with and also view 
- Data inside a composable unit is called STATE  
- TO manage this state android-kotlin utilizes the concept of a viewmode

### VIEWMODEL 
- observes the state updates in a composable which determines how a composable is drawn on the 
android screen 
-  apart from observing the data it also encapsulates business logic i.e. functions working on the 
data 

DASHBOARD SCREEN    ||      DASHBOARD SCREEN     ||        DASHBOARD SCREEN
a - TodoItemCard x1      a                                b 
                         b                               c 
                         c  Todoitem x2                

### ROOM DATABASE 
Steps to work with the room persistence database library 
1. Add the library dependencies to the build.gradle
   implementation("androidx.room:room-runtime:2.7.1")
   implementation("androidx.room:room-ktx:2.7.1")
2. Create Entity : select the model and annotate it with the 
@Entity(tableName = "")
3. Create a DATABASE ACCESS OBJECT (DAO) :: this will provide methods that
will perform operations on a database table records 
4. Create the databases classes : this will be used to track the different 
database versions i.e. migrations , we cam\n also include seed data in this
file : i.e. seed refers to mock data 
5. Create a repository to work with viewmodel 
     UI (composables ie. screens) -> Viewmodel -> Repository class 
     -> Room Database (DAO)
= The repository acts as : 
a. A single source of truth your data 
b. An abstraction layer between data sources 
c. The component to handle all data operations 
6. To provide the viewmodel on compilation we will
add a dependency manager :: HILT 
To add hilt to the project : 
a. In the build.gradle project level add this hilt 
plugin :  
id("com.google.dagger.hilt.android") version "2.56.1" apply false
b. In the build.gradle app level add the hilt dependency
   // Hilt core
   implementation("com.google.dagger:hilt-android:2.48")
   // For viewmodel support
   implementation("androidx.hilt:hilt-navigation-compose:1.2.0")


## DEPENDENCY INJECTION 
Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern 
that helps manage dependencies between different components 
(classes, objects, etc.) in a clean and maintainable way.
HILT : Dependency Inject manager 
        MainActivity (launched screen)
                     - showcase DashboardScreen 
       DashboardScreen - list of todos i.e lazycolumn 
                      - add to form , alertDialog
      DashboardViewmodel - observe changes on data 
                          CRUD  provided data via the 
                          repository 
     TodoRepository  -  gets data methods from Dao 
                       and provides it to the VM 

Steps 
1. Create an application class : this will denote our app as a hilt
app : allowing hilt to be used for DI  
2. Add the created hilt class in the manifest 
3. You need to tell HILT how to provide the repository to
the VM , create a module class to provide the info. 
4. Provide hilt to our VM 
5. Provide hiltViewModel to screen. 
6. Provide hilt to the launcher screen  i.e. MainActivity 
7. Get build - clean project 
8. file - invalidate caches - check all checkboxes 

### FIREBASE CRUD 
1. Add dependencies for firebase database 
implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-database-ktx")
   //firebase storage
   implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-storage")

### API integration 
Consuming data from an api endpoint i.e. /tasks
Key Implementations
// retrofit android library to communicate data over a network/internet 
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'
// convert to gson , so that we parse the json object which can be 
// converted to a model class 
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0'
// logging to capture all process as communication over the network 
// happens 
implementation 'com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:4.9.3'

// android expects all communications to be done over https : django 
projects run on http  
// dummy ngrok :: to server our local project over the internet 

### STEPS TO INTEGRATE APIS ON ANDROID 
1. You need a network communication lib package i.e. retrofit , volley ,
AndroidNetworking 
2. API url endpoint i.e. the ngrok process , exposed on https 
3. Endpoint should return data preferably a JSON content 
4. The JSON content will represent data classes where each object notation is 
a data class 
5. Create an interface class to establish the retrofit instances
for the HTTP verbs : ie GET POST DELETE PUT PATCH
